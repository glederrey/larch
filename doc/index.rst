This documentation is for the Python interface for Larch. If this is your first go
with Larch, or the first go on a new computer, you might want to start with :ref:`installation`.

This project is very much under development.  There are plenty of undocumented functions
and features; use them at your own risk.  Undocumented features may be non-functional, 
not rigorously tested, deprecated or removed without notice in a future version.  If a
function or method is documented here, it is intended to be stable in future updates.

You can download and install larch from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/larch>`__
by running `pip install larch`. Or you can get the source code from
`GitHub <https://github.com/jpn--/larch>`__.

For learning Python itself:

* If you are new to Python but have some experience with some other programming language,
  I recommend `Dive Into Python <http://www.diveintopython3.net>`__.
* If you are new to programming in general, there are better (slower) guides at
  `Learning Python <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/intro/learning/>`__
