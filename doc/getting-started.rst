Installation
------------

To run Larch, you'll need to have the 64 bit version of Python 3.5, plus a handful
of other useful statistical packages for Python.  The easiest way to get everything
you need is to download and install the `Anaconda <http://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_
version of Python 3.5 (64 bit). This comes with everything you'll need to get started,
and the Anaconda folks have helpfully curated a selection of useful tools for you,
so you don't have the sort through the huge pile of junk that is available for Python.

Once you've installed Anaconda, to get Larch you can simply run::

	pip install larch

from your command prompt (Windows) or the Terminal (Mac OS X).
